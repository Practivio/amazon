This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.

The term ‚Äúsignals‚Äù covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
