### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ turns multiple observed indicators into one 0‚Äì100 value within a price tier.  
When indicators are missing, uncertainty is acknowledged instead of estimated.

Signals are observed factors such as pricing, demand, and reviews.  
They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.

Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.
