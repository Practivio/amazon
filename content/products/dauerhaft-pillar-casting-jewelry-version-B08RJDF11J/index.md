Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
