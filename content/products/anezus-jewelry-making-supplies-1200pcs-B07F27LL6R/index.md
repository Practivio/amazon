Signals are observed factors such as pricing, demand, and reviews.  
They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

Confidence notes and evidence depth indicate the level of uncertainty.  
When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
