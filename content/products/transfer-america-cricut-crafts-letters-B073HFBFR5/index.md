### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Eligibility requires meeting fundamental criteria.  
This ensures fair alignment when assigning designations.

Signals are observed factors such as pricing, demand, and reviews.  
They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.
