### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We enforce baseline eligibility requirements.  
That way, the tiers reflect true product performance, not noise.

Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

Rather than plug holes in the data, we acknowledge and present limits.
