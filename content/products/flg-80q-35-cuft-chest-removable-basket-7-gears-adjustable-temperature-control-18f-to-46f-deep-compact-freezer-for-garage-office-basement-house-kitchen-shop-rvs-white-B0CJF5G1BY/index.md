### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0–100 Practivio Score™ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can’t be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
We define “signals” as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product’s position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
