### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and evidence depth indicate the level of uncertainty.  
When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
