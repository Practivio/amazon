### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

Our 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ aggregates observed signals to allow fair comparisons inside each tier.  
Missing data contributes to uncertainty, not fabricated values.

By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
