A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
