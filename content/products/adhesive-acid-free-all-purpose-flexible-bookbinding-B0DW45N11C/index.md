Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

We calculate a 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by blending multiple observed signals within each tier.  
If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
