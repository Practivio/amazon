### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Eligibility requires meeting fundamental criteria.  
This ensures fair alignment when assigning designations.

A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Evidence quality and confidence notes highlight uncertainty.  
Rather than plug holes in the data, we acknowledge and present limits.
