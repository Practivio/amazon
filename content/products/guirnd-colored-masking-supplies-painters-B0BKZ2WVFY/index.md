### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
All tier comparisons start with baseline eligibility checks.  
That keeps the designations meaningful and fair.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0–100 Practivio Score™ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can’t be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
We use the word “signals” to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers create level playing fields by grouping products with similar cost ranges.  
This ensures that rankings compare peers, not mismatched categories.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don’t substitute — we mark the score as less certain.
