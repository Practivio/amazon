We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
