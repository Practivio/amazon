Missing signals are treated as uncertainty, not assumptions.

Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
