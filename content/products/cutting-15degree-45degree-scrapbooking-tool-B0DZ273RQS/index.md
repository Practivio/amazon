### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We include only those products that meet required thresholds.  
This ensures tier designations reflect apples-to-apples comparisons.

A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
