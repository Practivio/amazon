Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
