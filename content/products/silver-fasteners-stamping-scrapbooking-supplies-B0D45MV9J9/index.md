### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
To qualify, products must first satisfy baseline thresholds.  
This keeps the evaluation pool consistent across all contenders.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.

Signals are observed factors such as pricing, demand, and reviews.  
They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
