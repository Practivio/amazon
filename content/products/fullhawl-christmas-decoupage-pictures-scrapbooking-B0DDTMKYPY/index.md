### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can‚Äôt be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
In this context, signals are the objective observations used to rank products alongside their tier peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
