### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
