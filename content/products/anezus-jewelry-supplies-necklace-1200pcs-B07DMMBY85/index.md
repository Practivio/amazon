### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Eligibility requires meeting fundamental criteria.  
This ensures fair alignment when assigning designations.

### FAQ: How the score works
Each product receives a Practivio Score™ (0–100) based on multiple observed indicators relative to its tier.  
Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They’re aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product’s position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

Uncertainty is always disclosed in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
