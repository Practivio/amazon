### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.

The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is always disclosed in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
