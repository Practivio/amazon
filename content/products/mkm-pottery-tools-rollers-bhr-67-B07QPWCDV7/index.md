### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
