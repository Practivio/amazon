### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
