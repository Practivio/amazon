We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
