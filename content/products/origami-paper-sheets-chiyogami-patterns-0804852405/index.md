### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

Signals are simply the observed factors that influence how a product stacks up against its tier peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
