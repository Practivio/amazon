### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate a 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by blending multiple observed signals within each tier.  
If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
