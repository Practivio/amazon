### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

### FAQ: How the score works
We merge observed indicators into a 0–100 Practivio Score™, tier by tier.  
Missing signals are treated as uncertainty, not assumptions.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals represent the evidence base — observations about each product — used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product’s standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
