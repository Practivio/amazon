Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
