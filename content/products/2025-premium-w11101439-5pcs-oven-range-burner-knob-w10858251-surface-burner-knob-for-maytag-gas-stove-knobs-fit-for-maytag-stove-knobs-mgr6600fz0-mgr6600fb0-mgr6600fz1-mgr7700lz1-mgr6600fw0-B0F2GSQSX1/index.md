A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

Tiers prevent skewed results by ensuring products are only compared with price-similar peers.
