### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty

When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
