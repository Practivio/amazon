### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers create level playing fields by grouping products with similar cost ranges.  
This ensures that rankings compare peers, not mismatched categories.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
