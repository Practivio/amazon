### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Products must clear minimum standards before entry.  
This keeps cohorts stable and designations accurate.

### FAQ: How the score works
Our 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ aggregates observed signals to allow fair comparisons inside each tier.  
Missing data contributes to uncertainty, not fabricated values.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
