### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
