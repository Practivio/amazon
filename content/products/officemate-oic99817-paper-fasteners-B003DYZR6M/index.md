All tier comparisons start with baseline eligibility checks.  
That keeps the designations meaningful and fair.

Our 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ aggregates observed signals to allow fair comparisons inside each tier.  
Missing data contributes to uncertainty, not fabricated values.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
