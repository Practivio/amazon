### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
The term ‚Äúsignals‚Äù covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
