Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They‚Äôre aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
