This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They‚Äôre aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.
