Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They‚Äôre aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.

Uncertainty is always disclosed in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
