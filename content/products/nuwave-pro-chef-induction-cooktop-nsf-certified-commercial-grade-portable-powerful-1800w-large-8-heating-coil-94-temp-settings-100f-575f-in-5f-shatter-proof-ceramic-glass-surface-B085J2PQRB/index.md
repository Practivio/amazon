### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0–100 Practivio Score™ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can’t be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals represent the evidence base — observations about each product — used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
