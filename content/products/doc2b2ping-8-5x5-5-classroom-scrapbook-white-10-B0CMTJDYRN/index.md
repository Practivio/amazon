This keeps the evaluation pool consistent across all contenders.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.  
That way, designations mean the same thing across the board.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
