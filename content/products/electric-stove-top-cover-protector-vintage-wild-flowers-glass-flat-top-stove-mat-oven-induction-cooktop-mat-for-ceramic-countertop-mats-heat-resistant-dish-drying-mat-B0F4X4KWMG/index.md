This step keeps the cohorts consistent and reliable.

A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
