### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
All tier comparisons start with baseline eligibility checks.  
That keeps the designations meaningful and fair.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Evidence quality and confidence notes highlight uncertainty.  
Rather than plug holes in the data, we acknowledge and present limits.
