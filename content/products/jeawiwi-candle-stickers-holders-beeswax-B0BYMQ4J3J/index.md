We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

Signals are observed factors such as pricing, demand, and reviews.  
They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
