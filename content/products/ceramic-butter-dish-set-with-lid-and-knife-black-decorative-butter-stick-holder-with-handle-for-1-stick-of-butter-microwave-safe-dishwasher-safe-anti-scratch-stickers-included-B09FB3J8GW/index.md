### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion is limited to items that clear our starting criteria.  
That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
