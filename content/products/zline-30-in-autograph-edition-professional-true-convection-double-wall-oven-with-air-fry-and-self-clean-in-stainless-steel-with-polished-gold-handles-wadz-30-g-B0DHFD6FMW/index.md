### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ turns multiple observed indicators into one 0‚Äì100 value within a price tier.  
When indicators are missing, uncertainty is acknowledged instead of estimated.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.  
That way, designations mean the same thing across the board.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is always disclosed in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
