We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.
