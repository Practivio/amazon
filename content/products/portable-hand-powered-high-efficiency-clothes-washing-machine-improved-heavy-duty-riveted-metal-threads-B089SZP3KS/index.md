### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion is limited to items that clear our starting criteria.  
That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
