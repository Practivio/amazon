### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ (0–100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

The term “signals” covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.

Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
