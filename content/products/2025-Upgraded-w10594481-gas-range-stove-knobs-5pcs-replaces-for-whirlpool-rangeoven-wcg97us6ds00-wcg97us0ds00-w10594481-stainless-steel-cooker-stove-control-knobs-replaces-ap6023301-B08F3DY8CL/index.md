### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline checks remove outliers and unqualified products.  
This protects the integrity of the tiers you see.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score™ by combining observed data into a 0–100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals represent the evidence base — observations about each product — used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers anchor comparisons to a product’s natural peer set.  
Rankings are relative to that group, not distorted by unrelated categories.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
