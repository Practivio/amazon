### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only products that pass our baseline filters are included.

Each product receives a Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) based on multiple observed indicators relative to its tier.  
Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
