Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
