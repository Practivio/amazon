### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion is limited to items that clear our starting criteria.  
That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
Each product receives a Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) based on multiple observed indicators relative to its tier.  
Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
