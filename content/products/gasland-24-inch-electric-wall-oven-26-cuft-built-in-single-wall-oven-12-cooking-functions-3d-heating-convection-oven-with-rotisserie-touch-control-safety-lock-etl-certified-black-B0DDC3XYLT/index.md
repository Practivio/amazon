A Practivio Score™ (0–100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

Inclusion of signals ensures that each product’s placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers establish fairness by grouping products with similar price constraints.  
Each score reflects a product’s standing inside its tier.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
