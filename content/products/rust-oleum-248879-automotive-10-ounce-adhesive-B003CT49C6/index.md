### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
