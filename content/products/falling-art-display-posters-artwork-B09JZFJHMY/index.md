We enforce baseline eligibility requirements.  
That way, the tiers reflect true product performance, not noise.

Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
