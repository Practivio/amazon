### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
All tier comparisons start with baseline eligibility checks.  
That keeps the designations meaningful and fair.

### FAQ: How the score works
Each product receives a Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) based on multiple observed indicators relative to its tier.  
Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and evidence depth indicate the level of uncertainty.  
When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
