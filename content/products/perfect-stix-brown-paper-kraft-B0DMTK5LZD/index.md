### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion is limited to items that clear our starting criteria.  
That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
In this context, signals are the objective observations used to rank products alongside their tier peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
