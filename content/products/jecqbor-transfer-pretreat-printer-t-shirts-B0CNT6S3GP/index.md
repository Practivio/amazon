The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
