### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers prevent skewed results by ensuring products are only compared with price-similar peers.  
This keeps every designation valid.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
