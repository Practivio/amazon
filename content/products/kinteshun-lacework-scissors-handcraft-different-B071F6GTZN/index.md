### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ (0–100) combines several observed indicators into one comparable number per price tier.  
Missing data raises uncertainty instead of filling with guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
We define “signals” as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers anchor comparisons to a product’s natural peer set.  
Rankings are relative to that group, not distorted by unrelated categories.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don’t substitute — we mark the score as less certain.
