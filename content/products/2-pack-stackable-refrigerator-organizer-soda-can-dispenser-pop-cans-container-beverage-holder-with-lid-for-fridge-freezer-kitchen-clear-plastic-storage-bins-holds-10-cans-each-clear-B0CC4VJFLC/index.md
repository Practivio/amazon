This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.
