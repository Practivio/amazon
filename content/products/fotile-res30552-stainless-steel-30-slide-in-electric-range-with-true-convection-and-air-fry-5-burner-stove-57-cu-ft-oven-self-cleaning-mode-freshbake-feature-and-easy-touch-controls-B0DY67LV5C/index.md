### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.

With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
