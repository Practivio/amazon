The Practivio Score™ (0–100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.

Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They’re aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

Evidence quality and confidence notes highlight uncertainty.  
Rather than plug holes in the data, we acknowledge and present limits.
