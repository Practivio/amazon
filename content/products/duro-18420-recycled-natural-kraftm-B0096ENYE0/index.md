### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ is a 0–100 measure combining multiple observed indicators within a price tier.  
If inputs are missing, we don’t substitute—we mark the score as less certain.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
By “signals” we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product’s standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don’t substitute — we mark the score as less certain.
