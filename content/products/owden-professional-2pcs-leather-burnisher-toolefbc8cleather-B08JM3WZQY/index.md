### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only products that pass our baseline filters are included.  
That keeps every designation valid and meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals represent the evidence base ‚Äî observations about each product ‚Äî used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
