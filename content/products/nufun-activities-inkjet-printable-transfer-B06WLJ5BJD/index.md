### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) combines several observed indicators into one comparable number per price tier.  
Missing data raises uncertainty instead of filling with guesses.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
