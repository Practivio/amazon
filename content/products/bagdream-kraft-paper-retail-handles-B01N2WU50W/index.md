### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline checks remove outliers and unqualified products.  
This protects the integrity of the tiers you see.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers anchor comparisons to a product‚Äôs natural peer set.  
Rankings are relative to that group, not distorted by unrelated categories.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
