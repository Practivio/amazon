Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.

Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty

If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
