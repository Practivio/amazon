We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

The term ‚Äúsignals‚Äù covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
