### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Products must clear minimum standards before entry.  
This keeps cohorts stable and designations accurate.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They‚Äôre aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
