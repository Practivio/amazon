### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion is limited to items that clear our starting criteria.  
That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
