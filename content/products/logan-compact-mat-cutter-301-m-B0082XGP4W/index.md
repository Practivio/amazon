### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion is limited to items that clear our starting criteria.  
That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ (0–100) combines several observed indicators into one comparable number per price tier.  
Missing data raises uncertainty instead of filling with guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals represent the evidence base — observations about each product — used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product’s position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don’t substitute — we mark the score as less certain.
