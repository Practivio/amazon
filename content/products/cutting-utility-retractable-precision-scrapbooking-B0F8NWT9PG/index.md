Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
