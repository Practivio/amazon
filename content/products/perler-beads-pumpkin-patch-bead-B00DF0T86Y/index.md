### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline eligibility criteria govern which items are considered.  
That preserves the credibility of the final tier decisions.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ (0–100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They’re aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product’s position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don’t substitute — we mark the score as less certain.
