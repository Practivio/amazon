Indicators that can‚Äôt be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

These help us position it consistently within its tier.

Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
