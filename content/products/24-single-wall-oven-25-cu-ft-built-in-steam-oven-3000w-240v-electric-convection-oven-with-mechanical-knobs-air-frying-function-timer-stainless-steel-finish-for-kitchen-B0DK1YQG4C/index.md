### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

The term ‚Äúsignals‚Äù covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
