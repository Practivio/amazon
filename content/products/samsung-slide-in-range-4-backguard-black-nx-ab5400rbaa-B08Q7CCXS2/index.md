Before comparison, each item must satisfy inclusion criteria.

If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
