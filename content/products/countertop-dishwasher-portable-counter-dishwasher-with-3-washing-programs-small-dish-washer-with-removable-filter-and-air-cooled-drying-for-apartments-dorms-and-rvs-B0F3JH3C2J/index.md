### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We enforce baseline eligibility requirements.  
That way, the tiers reflect true product performance, not noise.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
