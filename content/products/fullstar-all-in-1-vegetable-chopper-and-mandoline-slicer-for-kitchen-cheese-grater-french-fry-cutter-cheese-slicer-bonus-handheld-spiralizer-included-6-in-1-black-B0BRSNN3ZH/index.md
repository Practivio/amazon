### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

Signals represent the evidence base ‚Äî observations about each product ‚Äî used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don‚Äôt substitute ‚Äî we mark the score as less certain.
