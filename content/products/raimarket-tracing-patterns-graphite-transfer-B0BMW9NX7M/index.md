### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are simply the observed factors that influence how a product stacks up against its tier peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers anchor comparisons to a product‚Äôs natural peer set.  
Rankings are relative to that group, not distorted by unrelated categories.

Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
