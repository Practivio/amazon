Products are screened through inclusion gates before analysis.  
This step keeps the cohorts consistent and reliable.

A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.

These help us position it consistently within its tier.

Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
