A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

Signals are the measured indicators collected from each product.  
Together, they show where the item falls within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers anchor comparisons to a product‚Äôs natural peer set.  
Rankings are relative to that group, not distorted by unrelated categories.
