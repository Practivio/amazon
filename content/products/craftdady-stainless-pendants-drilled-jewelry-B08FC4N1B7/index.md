### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Products must clear minimum standards before entry.  
This keeps cohorts stable and designations accurate.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is always disclosed in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
