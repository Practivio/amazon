### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product’s placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers anchor comparisons to a product’s natural peer set.  
Rankings are relative to that group, not distorted by unrelated categories.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.
