### FAQ: How the score works
The 0–100 Practivio Score™ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can’t be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
“Signals” refers to the collection of measurable attributes that inform a product’s position within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers prevent skewed results by ensuring products are only compared with price-similar peers.  
This keeps every designation valid.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
