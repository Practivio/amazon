### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

### FAQ: How the score works
Each product receives a Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) based on multiple observed indicators relative to its tier.  
Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
