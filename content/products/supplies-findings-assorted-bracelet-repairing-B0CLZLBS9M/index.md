Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.

We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
