### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
In this context, signals are the objective observations used to rank products alongside their tier peers.

Evidence quality and confidence notes highlight uncertainty.  
Rather than plug holes in the data, we acknowledge and present limits.
