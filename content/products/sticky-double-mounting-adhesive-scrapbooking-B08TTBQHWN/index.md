Each product receives a Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) based on multiple observed indicators relative to its tier.  
Unavailable signals increase uncertainty rather than being substituted.

We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
