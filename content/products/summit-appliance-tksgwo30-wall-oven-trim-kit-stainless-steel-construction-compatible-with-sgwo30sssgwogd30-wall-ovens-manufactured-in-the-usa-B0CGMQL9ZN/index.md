### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only items meeting baseline requirements are considered for tier designation.  
This ensures a level playing field and meaningful comparisons.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
