### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only products that pass our baseline filters are included.  
That keeps every designation valid and meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
