That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
The term ‚Äúsignals‚Äù covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
