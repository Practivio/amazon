A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We treat signals as the aggregated inputs behind a product‚Äôs comparative standing in its price tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
