### FAQ: How the score works
The 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can‚Äôt be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
