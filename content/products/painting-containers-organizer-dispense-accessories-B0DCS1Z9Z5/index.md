### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
