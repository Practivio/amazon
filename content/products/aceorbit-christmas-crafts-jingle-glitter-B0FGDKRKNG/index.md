Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ is a 0–100 measure combining multiple observed indicators within a price tier.  
If inputs are missing, we don’t substitute—we mark the score as less certain.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They’re aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.
