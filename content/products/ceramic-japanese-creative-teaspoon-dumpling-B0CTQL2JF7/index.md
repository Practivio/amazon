### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline inclusion rules keep weaker or incomplete products out.  
This makes tier labels reliable and comparable.

We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
