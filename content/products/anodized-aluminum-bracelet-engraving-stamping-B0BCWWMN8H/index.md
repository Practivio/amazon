Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.

Uncertainty is reflected through the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When information is limited, we avoid filling gaps; results are presented conservatively.
