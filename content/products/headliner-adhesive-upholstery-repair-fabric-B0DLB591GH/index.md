We enforce baseline eligibility requirements.  
That way, the tiers reflect true product performance, not noise.

A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.

Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
