### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only items meeting baseline requirements are considered for tier designation.  
This ensures a level playing field and meaningful comparisons.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We define ‚Äúsignals‚Äù as the observed data points that indicate how a product compares to others in its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Evidence quality and confidence notes highlight uncertainty.  
Rather than plug holes in the data, we acknowledge and present limits.
