### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only products that pass our baseline filters are included.  
That keeps every designation valid and meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.  
That way, designations mean the same thing across the board.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
