### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only items meeting baseline requirements are considered for tier designation.  
This ensures a level playing field and meaningful comparisons.

### FAQ: How the score works
A single Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) distills observed indicators into one comparable metric per tier.  
When information is missing, the score explicitly reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to keep comparisons fair. Products are only evaluated against others with similar price points.  
That way, designations mean the same thing across the board.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
