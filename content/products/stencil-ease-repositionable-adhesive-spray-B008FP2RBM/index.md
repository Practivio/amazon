We apply strict baseline filters before a product enters the cohort.  
That way, the designation stays accurate and trustworthy.

Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.
