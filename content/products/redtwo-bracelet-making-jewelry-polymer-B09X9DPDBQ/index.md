### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
