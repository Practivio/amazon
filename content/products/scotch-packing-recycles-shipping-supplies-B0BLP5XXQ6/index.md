### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline checks remove outliers and unqualified products.  
This protects the integrity of the tiers you see.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate a 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by blending multiple observed signals within each tier.  
If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are the observed metrics gathered from the market.  
They‚Äôre aggregated to determine tier-relative positioning.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty appears as part of the evidence record and confidence notes.  
With incomplete information, we prefer restraint over estimates.
