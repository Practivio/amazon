### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only products that pass our baseline filters are included.  
That keeps every designation valid and meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score™ by combining observed data into a 0–100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product’s outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
