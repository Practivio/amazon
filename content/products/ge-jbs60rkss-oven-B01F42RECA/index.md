### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Before comparison, each item must satisfy inclusion criteria.  
This step maintains fairness across the ranking pool.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ turns multiple observed indicators into one 0‚Äì100 value within a price tier.  
When indicators are missing, uncertainty is acknowledged instead of estimated.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
