### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
