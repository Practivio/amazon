This ensures fair alignment when assigning designations.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are simply the observed factors that influence how a product stacks up against its tier peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?

If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
