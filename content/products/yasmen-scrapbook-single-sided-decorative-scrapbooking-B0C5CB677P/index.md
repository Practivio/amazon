### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Our baseline filters remove non-comparable items.  
That makes tier labels clear and defensible.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don‚Äôt substitute ‚Äî we mark the score as less certain.
