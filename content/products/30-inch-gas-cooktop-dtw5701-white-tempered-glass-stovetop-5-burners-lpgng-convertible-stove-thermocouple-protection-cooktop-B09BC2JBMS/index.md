### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
We only compare products once they meet the baseline standards.  
This ensures each tier reflects genuine head-to-head competition.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
