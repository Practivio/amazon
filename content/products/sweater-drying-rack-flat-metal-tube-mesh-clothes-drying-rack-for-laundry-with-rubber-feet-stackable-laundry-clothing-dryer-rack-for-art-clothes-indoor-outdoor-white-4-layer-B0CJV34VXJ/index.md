If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

Tiers group products with broadly similar constraints so comparisons remain fair and consistent.  
A product‚Äôs standing is always expressed relative to its tier peers, not across unrelated price bands.

If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
