### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Every product is screened against baseline measures.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and evidence depth indicate the level of uncertainty.  
When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
