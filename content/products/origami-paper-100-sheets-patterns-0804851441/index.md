### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Products must clear minimum standards before entry.  
This keeps cohorts stable and designations accurate.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ (0–100) combines several observed indicators into one comparable number per price tier.  
Missing data raises uncertainty instead of filling with guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
The term “signals” covers all the measurable indicators that guide where a product lands in the tier structure.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Price tiers keep evaluations apples-to-apples.  
Products are measured only within their own tier, never against unrelated price classes.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is flagged by confidence notes alongside the evidence base.  
Where inputs are missing, we don’t substitute — we mark the score as less certain.
