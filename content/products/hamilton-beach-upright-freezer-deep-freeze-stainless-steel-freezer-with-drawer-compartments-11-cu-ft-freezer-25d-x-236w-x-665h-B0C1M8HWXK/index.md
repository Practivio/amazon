### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Baseline checks remove outliers and unqualified products.  
This protects the integrity of the tiers you see.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0–100 Practivio Score™ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can’t be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
Signals represent the evidence base — observations about each product — used to anchor it within its peer group.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Without tiers, comparisons would unfairly pit budget items against premium ones.  
Grouping by price ensures meaningful, like-for-like evaluations.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
