That keeps the group fair and the tier designations meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
The 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.

Inclusion of signals ensures that each product‚Äôs placement is driven by observed evidence, not assumptions.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Confidence notes and evidence depth indicate the level of uncertainty.  
When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
