### FAQ: How the score works
The 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ integrates observed indicators into one tier-relative metric.  
Indicators that can‚Äôt be observed add uncertainty rather than guesses.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
We use the word ‚Äúsignals‚Äù to mean the combined observational data used to compare products within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
Uncertainty is always disclosed in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
When data is thin, our results emphasize caution.
