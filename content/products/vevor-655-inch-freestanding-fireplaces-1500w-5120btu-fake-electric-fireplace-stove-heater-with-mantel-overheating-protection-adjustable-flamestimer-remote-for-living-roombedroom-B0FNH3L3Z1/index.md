### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
All tier comparisons start with baseline eligibility checks.  
That keeps the designations meaningful and fair.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate the Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by combining observed data into a 0‚Äì100 scale per tier.  
Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are aggregated observations used to position a product among its peers in a given tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
The presence of uncertainty is made clear in both the evidence base and our notes.  
We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
