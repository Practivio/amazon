Unavailable data increases uncertainty instead of being replaced.

We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We show uncertainty directly in the evidence base and confidence notes.  
If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
