Signals are the observable features of a product that, when combined, determine its placement among peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.

Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
