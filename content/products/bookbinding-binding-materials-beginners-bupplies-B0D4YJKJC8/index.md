### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Only products that pass our baseline filters are included.  
That keeps every designation valid and meaningful.

### FAQ: How the score works
A Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) summarizes observed signals into a single number within each tier.  
If data is unavailable, uncertainty grows instead of being filled in.

### FAQ: What ‚Äúsignals‚Äù means here
Signals are simply the observed factors that influence how a product stacks up against its tier peers.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Tiers organize products into comparable groups by price.  
Each product‚Äôs position is measured against its tier peers, not against items from a different band.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty
We capture uncertainty through documented evidence and confidence commentary.  
Where data is missing, our approach is conservative, not assumptive.
