We enforce baseline eligibility requirements.  
That way, the tiers reflect true product performance, not noise.

The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ (0‚Äì100) integrates observed indicators across several dimensions, tier by tier.  
Unavailable data points increase uncertainty rather than being guessed.

These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.

Confidence notes and evidence depth indicate the level of uncertainty.  
When gaps exist, results lean cautious instead of filled-in.
