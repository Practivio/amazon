This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

### FAQ: How the score works
The Practivio Score™ is a 0–100 measure combining multiple observed indicators within a price tier.  
If inputs are missing, we don’t substitute—we mark the score as less certain.

### FAQ: What “signals” means here
“Signals” refers to the collection of measurable attributes that inform a product’s position within a tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product’s position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

Confidence notes and the evidence base make uncertainty transparent.  
If information is scarce, outcomes are shown conservatively, never guessed.
