We enforce baseline eligibility requirements.  
That way, the tiers reflect true product performance, not noise.

### FAQ: How the score works
We calculate a 0‚Äì100 Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ by blending multiple observed signals within each tier.  
If some data is missing, the score reflects that uncertainty.

They combine to place each product fairly within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
Grouping products into price tiers creates consistent, fair evaluations.  
Each product‚Äôs outcome is tied to its own tier, not to the entire market at once.

### FAQ: Interpreting uncertainty

If data is sparse, we present outcomes cautiously rather than speculate.
