### FAQ: Inclusion criteria
Inclusion depends on passing strict baseline criteria.  
This ensures our tier system reflects real, comparable value.

The Practivio Score‚Ñ¢ turns multiple observed indicators into one 0‚Äì100 value within a price tier.  
When indicators are missing, uncertainty is acknowledged instead of estimated.

By ‚Äúsignals‚Äù we mean the raw observations collected for each item.  
These help us position it consistently within its tier.

### FAQ: Why price tiers?
We use tiers to separate comparisons into fair groups.  
A product‚Äôs position is relative to its tier, never across unrelated price ranges.

We handle limited data conservatively, never with assumptions.
